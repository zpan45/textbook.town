	<h1>Project Retrospective</h1>
    
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
	  <p>The branching model we used on GitHub is very simple. 
		  We pull the files we need from master branch, and develop different tasks assigned to each person 
		  (we have branches for subtask like back-search, owner-bids, login…). After testing each person’s code, 
		  ensure there’s no bug, each person will push their code into our master branch.</p>
	  
	  <p>Our group uses many development tools/frameworks. For back-end, we used Python-flask to build the back-end code, 
		  MySQL to build database. For front-end, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript Jquery, and Mustache rendering System. 
		  All exchanges is made through REST API for extensibility.</p>
	  
	  <p>Our team managed task distribution effectively, we usually discuss about the distribution at the beginning of every
		  stage during group meeting and update the details on Trello. However, it’s super different to ensure that the work
		  assigned to each person is balanced. The reason is that, each member has different level and experience of programming,
		  some of us are already familiar with the languague we use, but some of us has no experience. In conclusion, although we 
		  cannot ensure everyone has same amount of work, the team still communicates and distributes the work well.</p>

    <h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
		<p>Our group communicated well with each other. Tasks were divided up evenly among members and each 
		person knew what they needed to complete. Deadlines were set and met by the group. If any member 
		struggled with a task, other members would help resolve any issues.</p>
		
		<p>The group could have worked more quickly and efficiently if more people were experienced with the 
		Python Flask backend system. It was challenging for members to learn this system and not much time was 
		available to truly learn and understand how it functions. It may have been better to have chosen
		a system that was easier to learn and apply (if such a system was available).</p>
		
		<p>It was interesting to see how a static webpage can be changed to a dynamic one through the use
		of Javascript functions. The elements of the webpage were more engaging and interacted better with
		the user. The Mustache rendering system used worked well across multiple pages and produced good 
		renders of the graphical elements. 
		
		<p>In an organizational perspective, the Trello site used to keep track of tasks was productive to the 
		project. All members can view the specific tasks that were assigned to them and moniter the progress
		of the group in general. It was a great tool to use.</p> 
		
		<p>The most troubling and challenging tool used in the project was Github. It was frustrating when 
		branches were merged together and conflicts occurred. It took a while to find the errors and fix them
		so that merging can be done successfully.</p>
