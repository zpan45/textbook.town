    <h1>User Demand</h1>
    <p>On a university campus, students frequently buy course textbooks that are used for a few months, only to be left on a shelf for the remainder of their useful life. The process of selling a textbook requires taking a hit of maybe 50% of the value when the book may have a useful life of 3-4 years. The only alternative is a loosely organized Facebook group which only allows crude posts of selling prices or lists of asks. This group has 26,468 Members at Western alone.</p> 

    <h1>Product Information</h1>
    <p>Our project aims to allow users to bid on the textbooks of other users, determining fair market values and maximizing the value received by sellers who often do not know how to price their books. Books are posted with photos which range from the best - worst pages in the book to allow users to better assess the quality of the book. Sellers are rated on a long term basis on the honesty of their quality assessments. This project is a web-based system with a platform restricted to Western University.</p> 

    <h1>Course</h1>
    <p>This project is being undertaken within CS2212, a Software Engineering course at Western University. CS2212 is a team project course that provides practical experience in the software engineering field. It includes an introduction to the structure and unique characteristics of large software systems, and concepts and techniques in the design, management and implementation of large software systems. </p> 

    <h1>Technology Stack</h1>
    <p>Our system will be built on a Python-Flask/MySQL backend engine which will connect to a JQuery / Vue.js / AJAX driven frontend. All exchanges will be made through REST API for extensibility. </p>
