      <h1>Project Plan</h1>
       <p> All requirements have been implemented and completed. Extra features (shown below) have 
	       not been completed and will remain as features to implement in the future.</p>
        <h2>Email Notifications</h2>
    <p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Using Postmark API we will dispatch email messages to the user accounts.</li>
    		<li>Users will need to verify their email in the registration process.</li>
    		<li>Users will be notified when a bid is complete that they participated in.</li>
			<li>Users will be notified if they won the bid to reach out to the seller.</li>  	
		</ul>
	  <b>Feasibility:</b> Email may be filtered. Bidding logistic would need modification. 
   <br><b>Dependency:</b> Depends on successful registration and usage of Postmark API.
    </p> 
    <h2>Post-sale Seller Rating</h2>
    <p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Sellers will need to mark with which of the 3 top bidders the transaction was completed.</li>
    		<li>This user will receive an email with 5 stars in it to select a rating for the seller.</li>
    		<li>Each star linking to a separate quick link which stores their rating. </li>
			<li>Seller profiles will contain the average of these ratings.</li>  	
		</ul>
		<b>Feasibility:</b> A fair marking scheme needs to be set up. 
   <br><b>Dependency:</b> Profile page may need modification. Depends on successful implement of the email system.
	</p>
   <h2>Social Media Login System</h2>
    <p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>User accounts can be created with social media as opposed to by email address and password.</li>
    		<li>Photo automatically pulled from the social media.</li>
    		<li>Facebook.</li>
			<li>Twitter.</li>  	
		</ul>
  <b>Feasibility:</b> Lots of coding need to be done.
   <br><b>Dependency:</b> Depends on successful registration and usage of Facebook/Twitter API. Registration/Login page and logistic may need modification.
    </p> 
    <h2>Offer Link to Book on Amazon</h2>
    <p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>If the searched book is not in our system, link to Amazon page to buy book will be displayed with Amazon referral program. </li>
    		<li>This amazon price will be showed on book listings to give an idea of the market value of a book.</li> 	
		</ul>
   <b>Feasibility:</b> Time may be insufficient to complete this feature.
   <br><b>Dependency:</b> depends on successful registration and usage of Amazon API.
    </p> 
    <p><h1>Further Ideas</h1></p>
   
     <h2>Autofill book characteristics when user is uploading the book</h2>
    <p>
    	<ul>

		</ul>
    </p> 
    <h2>User Dashboard Extension</h2>
