            <p style="float:right; display:block;">I’m a fourth year Social Science BMOS student with a Specialization in Finance and a Major in Computer Science. I have been interested in Computer Science since I was a little kid, and I’ve been keeping up with news in the industry; I know a little bit about everything there is to know. I have some experience with C, Java, Julia, HTML, CSS, Adobe Photoshop/Premiere Pro/Audition/Dreamweaver. I am interested in film shooting and editing, and plan on opening a studio with my friends soon.
