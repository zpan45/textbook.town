    <h1>Project Elixir UI/UX Plan</h2>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Project Elixir will follow the flat and minimal design principles but with the added twist of light layering and depth elements. The flat trend hit its trough in about 2015 and since flat color alone is seen as a bit boring unless very interesting twists are added in to it. For example check out <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> who have reintroduced gradients as well as stand out website elements. </p>

    <h2>Brand</h2>
    <p>Our brand image is tied to books, and moving them in unique ways. This inspired the design of our logo. Our name is also inspired by the product we move. Since we serve as a place for textbooks to be bought and sold, and for people to come together, we arrived at Textbook Town as a product name. Harnessing the recent trend in unique domains, textbook.town was obtained as our domain name.</p>

    <p>Our logo is inspired by the act our product performs, moving textbooks optimally.</p>
